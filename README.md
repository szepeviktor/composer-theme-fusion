A [Composer plugin](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/plugins.md)
to load WordPress plugins from [ThemeFusion](https://theme-fusion.com/).

:bulb: Always the latest version is installed, as ThemeFusion does not make other versions available.
Package version locking can only be achieved by local persistent cache, not across hosts or users.

### Installation

This Composer plugin must be installed globally as it adds a virtual package repository.

```shell
composer global require --update-no-dev szepeviktor/composer-theme-fusion
```

### Configuration

Add your token and theme version to your `config.json` (in `$COMPOSER_HOME`).

You find the `token` in WordPress option `fusion_registration_data`.
Get its value with e.g. WP-CLI `wp option get fusion_registration_data`.

```json
{
    "config": {
        "theme-fusion": {
            "token": "YOUR THEME-FUSION TOKEN",
            "themeVersion": "YOUR AVADA THEME VERSION, EG. '6.2.2'"
        }
    }
}
```

### Usage

Once the plugin is installed and configured,
you can simply install any of the **premium** plugins (e.g. `theme-fusion/fusion-core`) as Composer packages.
You find the list plugin slugs in this JSON:  
`https://updates.theme-fusion.com/?avada_action=get_plugins&avada_version=`

:bulb: Use the vendor name `theme-fusion`.

### Behind the scenes

1. This package is a Composer plugin
1. In the `activate` method it creates an `ArrayRepository`
   with package data from ThemeFusion API
1. Package version is queried from ThemeFusion API
1. When installing a package its URL is also queried from ThemeFusion API
